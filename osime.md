### OS in the modern era

_IN the 1980s, Bill Gates and Steve Jobs were fighting over how to make MS-DOS better_

_Steve Jobs copied the idea from Xerox, which came up with the GUI(Graphical User Interface)_

_Before GUI, operating systems were text based user interfaces_

_After seeing GUI, Steve Jobs created Macintosh and packed it in an attractive way for the average consumer_

_Computers used to be popular only  among hobbyists, but after operating systems came out, everybody could easily use them_

_There are three main operating systems today: WIndows, MacOS, and Linux_

_Windows' mission was to make an operating system that appeals to everyone_

_MacOS is even easier to use and more restricted_

_Linux is free (open source), anyone can modify it, and it's used mostly by technical people who want to have more control over the software_

_Operating systems that are similar to WIndows: Ubuntu and Fedora_
