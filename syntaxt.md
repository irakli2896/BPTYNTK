_All programming languages have the same core concepts, they are just expressed and written in different  way_

_Every language has it's own rules and it's own vocabulary_

> One of the first things you do when you learn programming it learn this rules

_Older languages have strict syntax, which means if u forget to put one sign or you capitalize the wrong letter the code will fail._

_For instance python will still work even if you get a few things wrong ._
