_Array = Series of pieces of information that are all formatted the same._

_Arrays can include numbers, stings, or variables (but not combined)._

> Using arrays saves time and it allows you to show more information more easily 

_If you need to use only one item from the array, you use a pointer._

_Pointers show what position each items of the array is in ._
