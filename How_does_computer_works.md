_Without humans to operate the computers they are just  dumb machines that don't do anything_

_By giving them specific instructions and commands, humans are communicating with the Central Processing Unit as we call it CPU, the core of the computer, where the problem gets solved_

_CPU - is a tiny silicon boxes attached to the motherboard_

_There are only two companies that make CPUs for personal computers.Intel and AMD_

_A transistor is a wire that can transfer electricity_

_The smallest CPU transistor is 0.05 microns_

_Processors are like a small calculators. It transfers electricity in circles, which we call a clock, and is measured in MIPS(Millions of Instructions Per Second)_

_Computers have permanent and temporary memories_

# Permanent memory is build in the form of a hard drive which stores your files

# Temporary memory is called RAM(Random Access Memory), and here the information is stored just for the duration of the program you are running
