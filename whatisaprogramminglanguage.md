_Programming is a way to write instruction for a computer to understand and work_

_Computers speak machine code_

_A programming language is a set of rules you have to follow in order for your computer to understand you_

_Programming languages are similar to human languages. They are good for only software or hardware that is designed to understand them_

_Programming has been developed over the years as the people contributed to it_

_Even though new languages are more efficient, a lot of products for instance operating systems we use are still based on old languages_
