#### The technology is constantly changing 
   * It doesn't mean that all the current trends will stick on the long term 
   * Stick with the stuff that has persisted over time 
   * What technology u use has no value to client 
   * If you have personal preference, choose that one
   * And last not least advice is: keep up to date with changes in the industry
